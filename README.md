- 👋 Hi, I’m @msanjola
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things to count or pursue, to be honest, but they're all deserving 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python ("learning" is hyperbole, I'm exposing myself to it, and this platform, fingers crossed eh) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on one or more concise future projects that I'll describe in future "readme" rabbit hole invitations. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... ah, yeah, I'll get to that in future for now I'm a noob low talent hobby coder with a short attention span
